# Net_Practice

## Summary
This project is a System Administration exercise focusing on networking. It consists of 10 levels, each representing a networking scenario that needs to be configured and solved.

## Introduction
The project aims to provide hands-on experience in configuring small-scale networks. The exercises require an understanding of TCP/IP addressing and involve solving networking problems to ensure the proper functioning of the network.

## General Guidelines
1. The project involves configuring networks through a training interface accessible via a web browser.
2. The networks in the exercises are simulated and not real.
3. Complete all 10 levels by configuring the networks according to the given scenarios.
4. Use the provided HTML interface to practice and check your configurations.
5. Export your configurations using the "Get my config" button for submission.

## Mandatory Part
1. Download the attached file and extract it to a folder.
2. Run the index.html file in the folder to open the training interface.
3. Practice by inputting your login or trying the correction version (leave the field empty).
4. Solve each level by configuring the network according to the specified goals.

## Submission and Peer-Evaluation
1. Turn in your assignment in your Git repository.
2. Submit 10 files (1 per level) at the root of your repository.
3. Use the "Get my config" button to export configurations for each level.
4. During the defense, succeed in 3 random levels within a limited time.
5. No external tools allowed during the evaluation.

## Resolution of Ten Levels (Examples)
### Level 1
- Configure IP addresses for Client A and Client B within the specified range.

### Level 2
- Configure IP addresses for Client B within a specific range considering the subnet mask.

### Level 3
- Configure subnet masks for Client A, Client B, and Client C on the same network.

### Level 4
- Choose subnet masks for interfaces to create non-overlapping networks.

### Level 5
- Set up routing for Client A with a default route to Interface R1.

### Level 6
- Ensure the internet sends packets to Client A without using reserved IP ranges.

### Level 7
- Create separate IP ranges for three networks, avoiding overlaps.

### Level 8
- Configure IP ranges for Client C and Client D for internet communication.

### Level 9
- Connect meson and cation to the internet without overlapping networks.

### Level 10
- Configure IP addresses and masks for four different networks.

## Conclusion
This Net_Practice project offers a practical understanding of networking concepts and configurations. Ensure accurate submissions for successful completion.
